Okay, it's very simple to install Jappix on your webserver, please check that things before you start :
	- You run Apache 2.X.X
	- Apache allows the .htaccess files (AllowOverride All)

Now, we gonna configure the Jappix options, just open the 'config' folder and open the two files of that folder. Just complete the things that you want to change, here we are.

Now, we will have to go a little bit further, with the http binding server configuration. In fact, the navigator's JavaScript restrictions make that we must configure a proxy on the same host the our js runs.

If you've ejabberd installed on your server, you can use it on the 5280 socket, else, you can try this (requires Java JRE) :
The last thing that you can do is to define this adress : http://jwchat.org/JHB/ directly in you .htaccess file, but please remember that you'll get dependent from a service that can be stopped at anytime !

Now, you can try Jappix to see if it works. Have fun !
